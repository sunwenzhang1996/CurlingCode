-------------
Dectect algorithm is YOLOV3-tiny retrained on our own curling dataset.
### Featuresï¼š
#### Visualization:
- Real-time situation of the track. (corrected and stitched from four cameras)
- Simulation result of curling trajectory.
- Heat map which stand for the friction of the surface.
- Different technical parameters.

#### Technical parameters:

Following technical parameters can be calculated from our algorithm. 
- trajectory
- different evaluations of time
- initial velocity and real-time velocity
- acceleration
- friction
- aim line
- rotations
- angular velocity
- positions
- distance from certain positions
